# M365 Assessment Framework - UI Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

Based on the screenshot provided showing the secure score section, the following issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. Empty Recommendations Section
**Problem**: The "Recommendations" section was showing empty content.
**Solution**: Updated `generateReportsForAssessment()` function to properly populate recommendations with:
- Generic security best practices
- Specific recommended actions from secure score API data
- Remediation advice from controls with highest score gaps
- License optimization recommendations

### 2. Missing Control Scores Table
**Problem**: The "Control Scores" section showed "100 items" but no table was visible.
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive CSS for `.security-controls-table` class
- Enhanced control scores data processing for both compressed and uncompressed data
- Added proper cell styling for all table columns (Control Name, Category, Scores, Status, Action Type, Remediation)
- Added debugging logs to track data flow issues

### 3. Data Processing Improvements
**Problem**: Control scores data wasn't being properly processed for display.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced data decompression logic for compressed secure score data
- Added fallback processing for uncompressed control scores
- Improved field mapping to handle different data formats
- Added validation and logging throughout the data pipeline

### 4. CSS Styling Enhancements
**Problem**: Missing or incomplete styling for secure score components.
**Solution**:
- Added `.security-controls-table` CSS class and styling
- Enhanced table cell styles for new columns (action-type, remediation, etc.)

- Improved responsive design for secure score tables
- Added row highlighting based on implementation status
