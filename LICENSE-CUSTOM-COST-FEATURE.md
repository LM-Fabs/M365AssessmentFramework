# License Management UI Improvements - Custom Cost Feature

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive license management UI improvement that addresses the formatting issues and adds flexible custom cost functionality.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **Strange License Name Formatting**
- **Issue**: License names appeared as "F L O W F R E E", "S P B", "M C O E V", etc.
- **Solution**: Enhanced the `formatLicenseName` function with:
  - Comprehensive mapping for spaced-out license names
  - Better pattern matching for detecting spaced letters
  - Additional mappings for common problematic names:
    - "F L O W F R E E" → "Power Automate (Free)"
    - "S P B" → "SharePoint Plan B"
    - "M C O E V" → "Microsoft Cloud App Security"
    - "P H O N E S Y S T E M V I R T U A L U S E R" → "Phone System Virtual User"
    - And many more...

### 2. **Added Custom License Cost Feature**
- **New functionality**: Users can now set custom costs for each license type
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `customLicenseCosts` state to track user-defined costs
  - Created `getEffectiveLicenseCost()` function that uses custom costs when available
  - Added `updateCustomLicenseCost()` and `resetCustomLicenseCost()` functions
  - Enhanced license table with new columns:
    - **Cost/User/Month**: Editable input field for custom costs
    - **Monthly Cost**: Calculated total monthly cost (cost × used licenses)
    - **Actions**: Reset button to revert to estimated costs

### 3. **Enhanced License Table**
- **New columns added**:
  1. **Cost/User/Month**: Shows estimated cost with ability to edit
  2. **Monthly Cost**: Displays calculated monthly expense
  3. **Actions**: Provides reset functionality
- **Visual indicators**:
  - Custom costs are highlighted with yellow background
  - Reset button (↺) appears only when custom cost is set
  - Currency indicator (USD) for clarity

### 4. **Improved CSS Styling**
- **New CSS classes for cost features**:
  - `.cost-cell`, `.monthly-cost-cell`, `.actions-cell`
  - `.cost-input-container`, `.cost-input`
  - `.cost-input.custom-cost` (highlighted custom costs)
  - `.reset-cost-btn` (reset button styling)
  - `.monthly-cost-amount` (formatted monetary display)
- **Responsive design**: Adjusted column widths and mobile responsiveness
- **Visual feedback**: Hover effects, focus states, and color coding

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [customLicenseCosts, setCustomLicenseCosts] = useState<{ [licenseName: string]: number }>({});
```

### Key Functions
- `getEffectiveLicenseCost(licenseName)`: Returns custom cost or estimated cost
- `updateCustomLicenseCost(licenseName, cost)`: Updates custom cost for a license
- `resetCustomLicenseCost(licenseName)`: Removes custom cost, reverts to estimated

### Enhanced License Processing
- License objects now include `cost` and `skuPartNumber` fields
- Both license processing paths updated to use effective costs
- Cost calculations integrated into monthly cost displays

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. **Flexibility**
- Users can now set realistic costs based on their actual licensing agreements
- Custom costs are visually distinct from estimated costs
- Easy reset functionality to revert to estimated costs

### 2. **Clarity**
- Clean, properly formatted license names
- Clear cost breakdowns with currency indicators
- Visual feedback for custom vs. estimated costs

### 3. **Functionality**
- Real-time cost calculations
- Persistent custom costs during session
- Intuitive UI with clear action buttons

## Visual Indicators

### Cost Input Field States
- **Default** (white background): Using estimated cost
- **Custom** (yellow background): Using user-defined cost
- **Focus**: Blue border with shadow for active editing

### Monthly Cost Display
- **Green text**: Emphasizes financial impact
- **Formatted currency**: Professional $ formatting with commas

### Reset Button
- **Visible only when needed**: Appears only for custom costs
- **Hover effects**: Visual feedback for interaction
- **Tooltip**: "Reset to estimated cost" for clarity

## Testing

### Build Status
✅ **Build successful**: No TypeScript errors or compilation issues
✅ **Development server**: Running successfully on localhost:3000
✅ **CSS integration**: All styles properly applied
✅ **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly layout maintained

### Next Steps for Testing

6. Check responsiveness on mobile devices
