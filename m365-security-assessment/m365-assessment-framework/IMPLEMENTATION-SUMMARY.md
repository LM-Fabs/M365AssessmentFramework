# M365 Assessment Framework - Update Summary

## Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

### 1. Separate Pages for Navigation Items
**Problem**: Dashboard, Assessments, Best Practices, and Reports all pointed to the same Dashboard component.

**Solution**: Created dedicated pages for each navigation item:

- **Assessments Page** (`/src/pages/Assessments.tsx`)
  - Dedicated assessment management interface
  - Customer selection and filtering
  - Assessment creation and history viewing
  - Links to detailed assessment results

- **Best Practices Page** (`/src/pages/BestPractices.tsx`)
  - Comprehensive security best practices library
  - Categorized recommendations (Identity & Access, Email & Collaboration, Data Protection, etc.)
  - Priority-based filtering (High, Medium, Low)
  - Search functionality
  - Resource links and implementation guides

- **Reports Page** (`/src/pages/Reports.tsx`)
  - Executive summary with key metrics
  - Assessment history table
  - Time-based filtering (30 days, 90 days, 1 year, all time)
  - CSV export functionality
  - Trend analysis for security scores

- **Updated Dashboard** (`/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
  - Now serves as a proper overview/landing page
  - Quick access to create assessments
  - Links to reports and other sections
  - Focused on high-level information

### 2. License Utilization Visibility
**Problem**: Users couldn't see detailed license usage and utilization data from assessments.

**Solution**: Enhanced license reporting throughout the application:

- **LicenseReport Component** (already existing, enhanced integration)
  - **Executive Summary**: Overall utilization rate, status, and recommendations
  - **Detailed Breakdown**: Per-license type usage (assigned vs. available)
  - **Cost Estimation**: Monthly cost calculations based on license usage
  - **Color-coded Status**: Visual indicators for utilization levels
  - **Category Grouping**: Premium, Standard, Basic, and Frontline licenses

- **Assessment Results Page** (`/src/components/AssessmentResults/`)
  - Full license utilization details for each assessment
  - Print and export functionality for license reports
  - Navigation from assessment lists

- **Reports Page Integration**
  - License utilization trends across multiple assessments
  - Average utilization rates over time
  - Cost tracking and analysis
