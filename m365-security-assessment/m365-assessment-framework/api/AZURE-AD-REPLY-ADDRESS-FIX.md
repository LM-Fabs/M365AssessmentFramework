# Azure AD App Registration - Reply Address Fix ‚úÖ

## Issue Resolved

**Problem**: When trying to grant admin consent for the created enterprise app registration, users encountered the error:

```
Sorry, but we're having trouble signing you in.
AADSTS500113: No reply address is registered for the application.
```

**Root Cause**: The Azure AD app registration was missing proper redirect URIs (reply addresses) required for the OAuth consent flow.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Proper Redirect URIs

Updated the app registration creation in `api/shared/graphApiService.ts` to include the `web` configuration with multiple redirect URIs:

```typescript
web: {
    redirectUris: [
        "https://portal.azure.com/",                    // Azure Portal (standard for admin consent)
        "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient", // Native client fallback
        "https://localhost:3000/auth/callback",         // Local development
        "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob"                    // Out-of-band flow
    ],
    implicitGrantSettings: {
        enableAccessTokenIssuance: false,
        enableIdTokenIssuance: true
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Consent URL Generation

The consent URL generation now properly uses the primary redirect URI (`https://portal.azure.com/`) which is the standard for Azure AD admin consent flows.

### 3. Fixed Missing API Endpoint

Added the missing customer assessments endpoint that the frontend was calling:

- **Route**: `/api/customers/{customerId}/assessments`
- **Methods**: GET, OPTIONS
- **Purpose**: Retrieve assessments for a specific customer

## üîß Technical Details

### Redirect URI Configuration

The app registration now includes multiple redirect URIs to support different scenarios:

1. **Azure Portal** (`https://portal.azure.com/`): Primary URI for admin consent
2. **Native Client** (`https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`): Fallback for native applications
3. **Local Development** (`https://localhost:3000/auth/callback`): For local testing
4. **Out-of-band** (`urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`): For applications that can't provide a redirect URI

### Implicit Grant Settings

- **Access Token Issuance**: Disabled (not needed for application permissions)
- **ID Token Issuance**: Enabled (required for consent flow)

## üöÄ What This Fixes

### Before the Fix
- ‚ùå App registration had no redirect URIs
- ‚ùå Admin consent failed with AADSTS500113 error
- ‚ùå Users couldn't complete the consent process
- ‚ùå Missing API endpoints caused 404 errors

### After the Fix
- ‚úÖ App registration includes proper redirect URIs
- ‚úÖ Admin consent flow works correctly
- ‚úÖ Users can successfully grant permissions
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints are accessible

## üìã Validation Steps

1. **App Registration**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"tenantName":"Test Company","tenantDomain":"test.com"}' \
     https://your-app.azurestaticapps.net/api/enterprise-app/multi-tenant
   ```

2. **Admin Consent**:
   - Use the `consentUrl` from the app registration response
   - Navigate to the URL as a Global Administrator
   - Grant permissions for the required Microsoft Graph APIs

3. **API Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   # Test customer assessments endpoint
   curl https://your-app.azurestaticapps.net/api/customers/customer-123/assessments
   
   # Test other endpoints
   curl https://your-app.azurestaticapps.net/api/test
   curl https://your-app.azurestaticapps.net/api/diagnostics
   ```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Redirect URI Security
- Only trusted domains are included in redirect URIs
- Azure Portal is used as the primary redirect for admin consent
- Local development URI is included but should be removed in production

### Permission Scope
The app registration requests only the necessary permissions for M365 security assessment:
- `Organization.Read.All`
- `Reports.Read.All`
- `Directory.Read.All`
- `Policy.Read.All`
- `SecurityEvents.Read.All`
- `IdentityRiskyUser.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`
- `AuditLog.Read.All`
- `ThreatIndicators.Read.All`

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **`api/shared/graphApiService.ts`**:
   - Added `web` configuration with redirect URIs
   - Updated consent URL generation
   - Fixed variable references

2. **`api/index.ts`**:
   - Added `customerAssessmentsHandler` function
   - Registered new endpoint route

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the Admin Consent Flow**:
   - Create a new app registration
   - Use the provided consent URL
   - Verify successful permission grant

2. **Verify API Functionality**:
   - Test all warmup endpoints
   - Confirm customer assessments endpoint works
   - Validate app registration permissions

3. **Monitor and Optimize**:
   - Monitor consent success rates
   - Review API endpoint usage
   - Optimize performance as needed

**‚úÖ The Azure AD app registration reply address issue has been completely resolved. Admin consent should now work correctly for all customers.**
