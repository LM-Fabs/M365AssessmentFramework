# Customer Loading Performance Improvements

## Summary of Optimizations Applied

### ðŸš€ Database Query Optimization
- **Single Query Instead of Two**: Combined customer data and count queries using window functions
- **Optimized Indexes**: Added composite indexes with covering columns for faster queries
- **Reduced Default Limit**: Changed from 100 to 50 customers per request for faster loading

### âš¡ Client-Side Performance  
- **Extended Cache Duration**: Increased from 2 minutes to 5 minutes
- **Background Prefetching**: Added smart background refresh when cache is 80% expired
- **Immediate Prefetch**: CustomerSelector now starts prefetching immediately on mount
- **Reduced Timeout**: Lowered API timeout from 45s to 30s for normal requests

### ðŸ”§ Database Schema Improvements
- **Covering Index**: Added index that includes commonly queried columns
- **Composite Index**: Optimized for `status` + `created_date DESC` queries
- **CONCURRENTLY**: Uses non-blocking index creation

### ðŸ“¡ API Response Optimization
- **HTTP Caching**: Added proper Cache-Control headers (1 minute cache)
- **ETags**: Added for better browser caching
- **Compressed Responses**: Optimized JSON response structure

## Expected Performance Improvements

| Area | Before | After | Improvement |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Database Query | 2 separate queries | 1 optimized query | ~50% faster |
| Cache Duration | 2 minutes | 5 minutes | 2.5x less API calls |
| Default Load | 100 customers | 50 customers | ~40% faster transfer |
| Background Refresh | Manual only | Smart prefetch | Perceived instant loading |
| API Timeout | 45 seconds | 30 seconds | 33% faster failure detection |

## Code Changes Made

### 1. PostgreSQL Service (`api/shared/postgresqlService.ts`)
```sql
-- New optimized query with window function
SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER() as total_count 
FROM customers 
WHERE status = 'active' 
ORDER BY created_date DESC 
LIMIT 50;
```

### 2. Customer Service (`src/services/customerService.ts`)
- Extended cache from 2min â†’ 5min
- Added background prefetch at 80% cache age
- Reduced API timeout from 45s â†’ 30s

### 3. CustomerSelector Component (`src/components/ui/CustomerSelector.tsx`)
- Added immediate prefetch on component mount
- Improved error handling for faster failure detection

### 4. API Endpoint (`api/customers/index.ts`)
- Reduced default limit from 100 â†’ 50
- Added HTTP caching headers
- Added ETag support

## Database Indexes Added

```sql
-- Performance indexes for faster customer loading
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_customers_status_created_date 
ON customers(status, created_date DESC);

-- Covering index with commonly accessed columns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_customers_covering 
ON customers(status, created_date DESC) 
INCLUDE (tenant_name, tenant_domain, total_assessments, last_assessment_date);
```

## How to Test Performance Improvements

1. **Clear browser cache** to test cold loading
2. **Monitor browser Network tab** for response times
3. **Check console logs** for cache hit/miss indicators
4. **Navigate between pages** to test background prefetch

## Expected User Experience

- **First Load**: ~30-50% faster due to optimized queries and reduced data
- **Subsequent Loads**: Nearly instant due to improved caching
- **Background Updates**: Seamless cache refresh without user awareness
- **Error Recovery**: Faster timeout and retry for better UX
