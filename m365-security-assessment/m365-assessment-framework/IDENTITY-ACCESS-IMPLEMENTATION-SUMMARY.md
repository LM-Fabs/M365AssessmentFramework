## ðŸ“Š Data Processing

### Authentication Method Classification
```typescript
// Strong Methods (15 total)
- microsoftAuthenticatorPasswordless
- fido2SecurityKey
- passKeyDeviceBound
- windowsHelloForBusiness
- hardwareOneTimePasscode
// ... and more

// Weak Methods (5 total)
- SMS
- Voice Call
- email
- alternateMobilePhone
- securityQuestion
```

### User Analysis
- **Privileged User Detection**: Directory roles and PIM integration
- **External User Identification**: Guest account filtering
- **Sync User Recognition**: Directory synchronization account detection
- **Method Registration Analysis**: Strong vs weak method usage patterns

## ðŸ”„ Service Architecture

### Caching System
- **30-minute default timeout** with configurable options
- **Request deduplication** to prevent duplicate API calls
- **Background refresh capability** for data freshness
- **Cache statistics** for monitoring and optimization

### Microsoft Graph Integration Ready
```typescript
// API Endpoints (Implementation Ready)
- GET /organization
- GET /reports/authenticationMethods/userRegistrationDetails
- GET /policies/authenticationmethodspolicy
- GET /directoryRoles
- GET /roleManagement/directory/roleEligibilitySchedules
```

## âœ… Quality Assurance

### TypeScript Compilation
