# Security Categories Selector Implementation

## Implementation Summary

‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Added "Security Categories to Include" selector to Reports page

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Reports Component (`src/pages/Reports.tsx`)

**New State Management:**
- Added `selectedCategories` state to track which security categories are selected
- Added `handleCategoryChange` function to manage checkbox selections
- Default selection includes: `['license', 'secureScore', 'identity']`

**Assessment Integration:**
- Updated `handleTestCreateAssessment` to use `selectedCategories` instead of hardcoded categories
- Dynamic category inclusion based on user selection

**User Interface:**
- Added "Security Categories to Include" section that appears when a customer is selected
- Checkbox interface with visual category cards
- Each category shows icon, name, and description
- Real-time feedback showing number of categories selected
- Excludes 'error' category from user selection (handled automatically)

#### 2. Category Selection Interface

**Available Categories:**
- üìä **License Management** - License utilization, costs, and optimization opportunities
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Score** - Security posture analysis and improvement recommendations
- üë§ **Identity & Access** - User management, MFA coverage, and access policies ‚Üê NOW SELECTABLE
- üîí **Data Protection** - DLP policies, encryption, and data governance

#### 3. Styling Updates (`src/pages/Reports.css`)

### User Workflow

1. **Customer Selection**: User selects a customer from dropdown
2. **Category Configuration**: "Security Categories to Include" section appears
3. **Category Selection**: User can check/uncheck desired security categories
4. **Real-time Feedback**: Selection counter updates dynamically
5. **Assessment Creation**: "Create Test Assessment" uses selected categories
6. **Report Generation**: Only selected categories are included in assessment

### Integration Points

**Backend Integration:**
- Uses existing `AssessmentService.createAssessmentForCustomer()` method
- Passes `selectedCategories` array to `includedCategories` parameter
- Maintains compatibility with existing assessment infrastructure

**Frontend Integration:**
- Seamlessly integrated into existing Reports page layout
- Appears between customer selection and debug controls
- Uses existing `securityCategories` array for consistent category definitions
- Maintains state across customer selections

### Technical Implementation

**State Management:**
```typescript
const [selectedCategories, setSelectedCategories] = useState<string[]>(['license', 'secureScore', 'identity']);

const handleCategoryChange = (categoryId: string, isChecked: boolean) => {
  setSelectedCategories(prev => {
    if (isChecked) {
      return [...prev, categoryId];
    } else {
      return prev.filter(id => id !== categoryId);
    }
  });
};
```

**Assessment Creation:**
```typescript
const assessment = await AssessmentService.getInstance().createAssessmentForCustomer({
  customerId: selectedCustomer.id,
  tenantId: selectedCustomer.tenantId,
  assessmentName: `Test Assessment ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
  includedCategories: selectedCategories, // ‚Üê Uses selected categories
  // ... other parameters
});
```

### Benefits

1. **User Control**: Users can now customize which security areas to assess
2. **Efficiency**: Allows focused assessments on specific security domains
3. **Flexibility**: Can enable/disable Identity & Access Report per assessment
4. **Performance**: Reduces assessment time by only running selected categories
5. **User Experience**: Clear visual interface with immediate feedback
