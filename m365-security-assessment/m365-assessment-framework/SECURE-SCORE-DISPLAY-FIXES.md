# Secure Score Display Fixes

## Issues Addressed

Based on the screenshot analysis, the following issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. Percentage Showing 0 Despite Valid Score
**Problem**: Percentage displayed as 0 even though current score was 940.29 out of 1334 max score
**Root Cause**: The percentage calculation logic had issues and the Microsoft Graph API might not always provide a percentage field
**Solution**: Enhanced percentage calculation in `api/assessments/index.ts` with proper fallback logic:
```typescript
percentage: secureScore?.percentage || 
          (secureScore?.maxScore > 0 ? 
           Math.round((secureScore?.currentScore || 0) / secureScore.maxScore * 100) : 0)
```

### 2. Malformed Date Display
**Problem**: Date showing as raw ISO string "2025-08-01T06:07:32.420Z" instead of readable format
**Root Cause**: Frontend was displaying raw date values without formatting
**Solution**: Added date formatting in `src/pages/Reports.tsx`:
```typescript
key === 'lastUpdated' ? (
  // Format date properly
  typeof value === 'string' ? new Date(value).toLocaleDateString() : String(value)
) : (
```

### 3. Total Controls Found Showing "undefined"
**Problem**: The totalControlsFound field was missing from the secure score data
**Root Cause**: API wasn't setting this field when processing secure score data
**Solution**: Added `totalControlsFound` field in `api/assessments/index.ts`:
```typescript
totalControlsFound: (secureScore?.controlScores || []).length
```

### 4. Duplicate Secure Score Overview Section
**Problem**: The secure score overview was displayed twice - once in metric cards and once in a dedicated section
**Root Cause**: Redundant "Security Score Overview" section in the secure score table component
**Solution**: Removed the duplicate overview section from `src/pages/Reports.tsx`, keeping only the metric cards display

## Files Modified

### API Changes
- `api/assessments/index.ts`: 
  - Enhanced percentage calculation logic
  - Added totalControlsFound field
  - Improved lastUpdated handling

### Frontend Changes
- `src/pages/Reports.tsx`:
  - Added date formatting for lastUpdated field
  - Removed duplicate secure score overview section

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ **Percentage** should show calculated value (940.29/1334 ≈ 70%)
2. ✅ **Date** should show readable format (e.g., "8/1/2025")  
3. ✅ **Total Controls Found** should show actual count instead of "undefined"
4. ✅ **No duplication** between metric cards and overview section

## Testing

Both frontend and API builds completed successfully:
- Frontend: -131 bytes code reduction (optimized)
- API: Compiled without errors

## Deployment

The fixes are ready for deployment. The next assessment created should display:
- Correct percentage calculation
- Properly formatted dates
- Valid control counts
- Clean interface without duplication

## Technical Notes

- The percentage calculation now uses a fallback mechanism when Microsoft Graph API doesn't provide the percentage field
- Date formatting handles both string and Date object inputs
- The totalControlsFound field is calculated from the actual control scores array length
- Removed redundant UI elements to streamline the secure score display
